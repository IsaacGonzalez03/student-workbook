# Day 2
# What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
Pseudo classes are keywords that start with colons that do specific things. I can imagine the :hover pseudo class will be used frequently
# What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
Specificity tells us which rules to follow when rules are targeting the same element. Knowing specificities, we can use specific selectors to manipulate the style sheet.
# What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
The important property could cause issues in css since it overides other declarations. It would make a mess if they were used often.
