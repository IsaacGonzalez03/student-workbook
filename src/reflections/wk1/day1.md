# In your own words, why do we use Git?
We use git to work on code simultaneously with other developers locally.
# What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
Code can be branched and tested and developed simultaneously while the main code is still worked on. The code is different from the main code but can be merged if needed.
# What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git allows us to work on code locally, and Github is to be worked on through the cloud based repository
