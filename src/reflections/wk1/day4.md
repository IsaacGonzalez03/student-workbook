# Day 4 
# What is the purpose of wire-framing?
The purpose of wire framing is to get the "wires" of a website set up, and to understand what we want the user to do, before we actually go out and build the thing.
# What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
Low-mid-high fidelity frames are the different levels. Our LF frame is a rough draft on paper, the MF frame is a draft in figma, our HF frame is still in figma, but now we're using actual content and fine tuning it before we put it into code.
# Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
I like wire frames because they bring organization and design to the forefront of the project. I believe it is important to mock up and have a direction before trying to code.
