# Day 4
What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
value type with a constant number and name associated with it

How can you modify an Enum?
Youre not supposed to, theyre supposed to be static?

How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
I used enums for rock paper scissors giving my strings a # and using the constant # to create game logic
