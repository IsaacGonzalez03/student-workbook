# Day 2
# What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
Function declarations are defined functions that are hoisted and can be accessed before being defined.
function expressions are nameless and unhoisted, therefore they need to be defined. 
# What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
Parameters are used to help define functions, while arguments are what is passed through the function when its invoked.
# What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
When functions accept other functions as parameters they are considered higher order.  The array functions we use are higher order.
