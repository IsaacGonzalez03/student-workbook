# Day 3

# What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
printing to the console is great for making sure code is working in small chunks.
error messages are also helpful to find buggy lines of code.
# Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
sources tab will let you see css and html, and will also let you edit those on the fly
# Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
the code editor in the console is helpful, also break points are helpful as they pause code in specified areas.
the debugger is also awesome because it takes you line for line.
