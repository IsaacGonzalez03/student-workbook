# Day 4 
# What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
It can prevent having to go back and rewrite code if proper variables and keys if thought out a little more.
# How do you find answers when you are stuck?
Googling stuff! more often than not someone else has run into the same issue.
# From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
its okay to fail, its okay to quit and find a different way to do things, google is a great resourse.  
dont have to prematurely optimize the code.
take lots of short breaks while coding, get fresh eyes on the project.
just because things work doesnt mean theyre right!
