# Day 4

# What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
It seeks to solve the problem of updating small pieces of information without manipulating large pieces of data as a whole



# What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

subscribe,unsubscribe,broadcast.

# Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
The goal is to build reusable accessable and functional code.
