# What problem does using exports solve?
Exporting solves the problem of not being able to use variables in other places. it essentially creates public variables.
# How does export differ from export default?
Export default allows you to export multiple variables, while export default only allows one.
# What is a benefit of using the Module System?
It helps break up the code into digestable pieces and only allows code to be accessed by code that needs to access the particular pieces
