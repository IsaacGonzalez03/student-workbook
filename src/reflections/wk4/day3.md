# Day 3
# What is the purpose of Async/Await?
async establishes a promise of data - await waits until code is executed up to a point
# What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?
function is paused until the promise settles if it fulfills you get your value back, if not it rejects
# What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?
increased responsiveness when long running applications exist
makes code neat and easier to read
no long threads
